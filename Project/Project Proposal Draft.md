### Dataset Description
This is the Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+Comment+Volume+Dataset) from UCI Machine Learning Repository (Ref: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). The instances in this dataset contain the information and characteristics about the Facebook post, and there are 53 features of comments (including Page Popularity/likes, Page Checkins, Page talking about, etc.) as input variables and the number of comments as a target variable extracted from the facebook post.

### Project Title
Facebook Comment Volume Prediction

### Motivation
Nowadays, the data of social networks keeps growing, and Facebook is one of the most popular social software. Many companies are exploring the potential commercial value.

According to the research, user-generated content drives higher Facebook engagement than ads (Ref: https://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-user-generated-content-drives-higher-facebook-engagement-than-ads/436139/). Comment volume generated by a post indicates the popularity of the post.

Therefore, from potential business commercials, creating a model to predict the number of comments of the Facebook post that will receive can lead to more effective marketing purposes and strategies such as the accuracy of advertising for companies and other institutions.

### Statement of the Problem/Task
* In this project, our objective is to predict how many comments a user-generated post is expected to receive in a specific time by using Facebook Comment Volume Dataset Data Set. We need to model based on the provided input variables of user comment patterns to predict the number of comments for the post in a specific time with the highest accuracy
* Task 1: Build regression models (like KNN, Decision Tree, Deep Learning, other Machine Learning approach and so on) based on the dataset
* Task 2: Compare and choose models based on different evaluation indicators
* Task 3: Combine the chosen models to make an ensemble model to predict the volume of comments

### General Approach
1. Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering
    * Missing Values Treatment
    * Outlier Treatment
    * Dimensionality Reduction
        * Low Variance Filter
        * Irrelevant Variable Treatment
        * ...
    * Feature scaling
    * Data transformation
    * Data Split (Training and Testing)
    * ...
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    * Use data visualization to analyze data
        * Univariate Analysis
        * Bivariate Analysis
        * Correlation Plot
        * Outliers
        * Scatter Plot
        * ...
3. Modeling
    * Use K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Fully Convolutional Neural Network, (Extends at least one: Naive Bayesian, Random Forest, Time Series, Regression Tree, Fully Convolutional Neural Network, Radial Basis Function Network) to build regression models and combine them to make an ensemble model to predict the volume of comments
4. Model Validation
    * Normality of the Residual
    * Influence Points
    * Multicollinearity
    * ...
5. Model Comparison and Evaluation
    * Use Cross-Validation with Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error and R-Squared, Evaluation Time (Extends at least one: Hits@10, Area Under Curve (AUC@10), Statistical Testing, ANOVA Testing) to evaluate the models

### Evaluation
* Satisfactory Project Outcome (C grade)
    * Use K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree to build regression models and combine them to make an ensemble model to predict the volume of comments
    * Use Cross-Validation with Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error and R-Squared, Evaluation Time to evaluate the models
    * Combine the suitable models based on Model Evaluation to make an ensemble model to predict the volume of comments
